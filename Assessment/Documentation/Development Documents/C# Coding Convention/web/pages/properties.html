 <h3> 2.5	Properties, fields, parameters and variables</h3>
        <p>•	Property name begins with capital letter: JobId (Pascal case).</p>
<p>•	Use a read-only property when the user cannot change the property's logical data</p> <p>member. Do not use write-only properties.</p>
<p>•	Field name begins with small letter. If a field is a property's logical data member, it</p> <p>gets the same name as the property (if property name is JobId the field name for this <p>property is jobId).</p>
<p>•	Do not use fields that are public. A field can be declared as public for a global</p> <p>constant (instead of using property with get accessor). In the last case capitalize the name</p> <p>of the field. </p>
<p>	Interface classes should not have protected fields.</p>
<p>•	Local variable names and parameter names begins with small letter. Use camel case.</p>
<p>•	Name of a constant is capitalized. The concatenated words are separated by “_” sign:</p> <p>APPLICATION_NAME.</p>
<p>•	Boolean property/field/variable/parameter name should start with prefix “is”, “has” or</p> <p>“does” which implies True/False values (doesFileExist instead of fileExists).</p>
<p>•	Even for short-lived local variables still use a meaningful name. Use single-character</p> <p>names: ‘i’, ‘j’, ’k’, ’l’, ’m’, ’n’  for loops variables; ‘x’, ‘y’, ‘z' for coordinates; <p>‘r’, ‘g’, ‘b’ for colors, ‘e’ for event argument.</p>
<p>•	Consider using named constants in conditions instead of numbers. The exceptions are 0,</p> 
            <p>1 and –1. ( for i=0; i NUM_DAYS_IN_WEEK; i++ instead of for i=0; i<7; i++  ). However it is</p> 
            <p>possible to use number if it is used in one place only and this does not make sense to </p><p>define it as a constant. In the case a number is used in condition a comment has to be added </p><p>to explain meaning of the number used.</p>
           <p> •	Avoid using hard coded strings for messages that are displayed to user.</p> <p>Use a named constant, a database record or resource file item instead.</p>
<p>•	While building strings for custom messages use formatted strings: </p>
<p>MES_DELETE = "File {0} deleted.";</p>
            <p>. . . </p>
            <p>res = String.Format(MES_DELETE, drawFile.Name);</p>
