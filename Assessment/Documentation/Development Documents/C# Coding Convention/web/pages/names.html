 <br>  <h3>1.Introduction</h3>
<br>The goal of this document is to provide a standard coding technique for C#.Net projects <br>hold by the members of MS Solutions team. The techniques defined here are not proposed to <br>form an inflexible set of coding standards. They are rather meant to serve as a guide for <br>developing a coding standard for a specific software project. 

<br>	<h3>2.Names</h3>
        <ul>
<br>The naming rules have key importance to understanding the logic of the application. 
<br><li>The main general rule is: “A name should tell ‘what’ rather then ‘how’” [1].</li>
<br><li>Make names long enough to be meaningful but short enough to avoid verbosity.</li>
<br><li>Provide names that a reader can comprehend. </li>
<br><li>Avoid redundant class names while naming properties and methods (List.ListItem should <br>be named as List.Item).</li>
<br><li>	Components must be fully usable from both case-sensitive and case-insensitive languages. <br>Therefore don’t create namespaces, class names, property names, method names, parameters names etc. that differ only by case.</li>
<br><li>	Avoid using class names that duplicate commonly used .NET Framework namespaces, such as: System, Collections, Forms, UI, etc.</li>
</ul>
